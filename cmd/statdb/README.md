# gRPC Server

This is a gRPC server which handles CRUD (create, read, update, delete) requests for storing stats for farmers in a relational database

To run the server:
```
go run cmd/pointerdb/main.go
```
You can also run using these flags: `-port=<port-number> -prod=<bool> -db=<db-name>`

You can then write a client program using the client library to access the Create, Get, Update, and UpdateBatch methods to create and interact with farmer stat entries stored in the DB.
An example program utilizing these functions can be found at `storj.io/storj/examples/statdb-client/main.go`.

If changes are made to `storj.io/storj/pkg/statdb/proto/statdb.proto, the protobuf file will need to be regenerated by running `go generate` inside `pkg/statdb/proto`

If changes are made to `storj.io/storj/pkg/statdb/dbx/statdb.dbx, the dbx files will need to be regenerated by running `go generate` inside `pkg/statdb/dbx`
