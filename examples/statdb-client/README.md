# gRPC Client

This is an example gRPC client which makes requests for updating and storing farmer stats in a relational database.

The gRPC server at `storj.io/storj/cmd/statdb/main.go` needs to be running for this to work.

To run the client:
```
go run examples/statdb-client/main.go
```
You can change the port number with a flag if necessary: `-port=<port-number>`

If changes are made to `storj.io/storj/pkg/statdb/proto/statdb.proto, the protobuf file will need to be regenerated by running `go generate` inside `pkg/statdb/proto`

If changes are made to `storj.io/storj/pkg/statdb/dbx/statdb.dbx, the dbx files will need to be regenerated by running `go generate` inside `pkg/statdb/dbx`
