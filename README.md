Storj is in the midst of a rearchitecture. Please stay tuned for our v3 whitepaper!

Storj is a platform, token, and suite of decentralized applications that allows you to store data in a secure and decentralized manner. Your files are encrypted, shredded into little pieces and stored in a global decentralized network of computers. Luckily, we also support allowing you (and only you) to recover them!

## To start developing

### Install required packages

First of all, install `git` and `golang`.

#### Debian based (like Ubuntu)

```bash
apt-get install git golang
echo 'export GOPATH="$HOME/go"' >> $HOME/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:${GOPATH//://bin:}/bin"' >> $HOME/.bashrc
source $HOME/.bashrc
```

#### Mac OSX

```bash
brew install git go
if test -e $HOME/.bash_profile
then
	echo 'export GOPATH="$HOME/go"' >> $HOME/.bash_profile
	echo 'export PATH="$PATH:${GOPATH//://bin:}/bin"' >> $HOME/.bash_profile
	source $HOME/.bash_profile
else
	echo 'export GOPATH="$HOME/go"' >> $HOME/.profile
	echo 'export PATH="$PATH:${GOPATH//://bin:}/bin"' >> $HOME/.profile
	source $HOME/.profile
fi
```

### Install storj

Clone the storj repository. You may want to clone your own fork and branch.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/storj/storj $GOPATH/src/storj.io/storj
```

#### Install all dependencies

`go get` can be used to install all dependencies. The execution will take some time. You can add -v if you want to get more feedback.

```bash
go get -t storj.io/storj/...
```

Fix error message `cannot use "github.com/minio/cli"` See https://github.com/minio/minio/issues/5974 for more details.

```bash
go get -t github.com/minio/cli && rm -rf $GOPATH/src/github.com/minio/minio/vendor/github.com/minio/cli
go get -t storj.io/storj/...
```

### Run unit tests

```bash
go clean -testcache
go test storj.io/storj/...
```

You can execute only a single test package. For example: `go test storj.io/storj/pkg/kademlia`. Add -v for more informations about the executed unit tests.

### Start the network

```bash
go install -v storj.io/storj/cmd/captplanet
captplanet setup
captplanet run
```
